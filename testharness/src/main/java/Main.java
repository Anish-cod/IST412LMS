/*should consist of a) controller components passing control between themselves as envisioned in your design, and
b) controller components calling the APIs of their view and model components, again as envisioned in your design.

The testharness module should include a main method and be runnable. When it is run it should execute a series of
tests with appropriate output statements communicating whether the tests have passed or failed. The test harness
module will need to instantiate at least one controller class to begin the test, which in turn instantiate other
controller, view, and model classes and exercise their APIs. You may want to include test output statements in your
method stubs to reduce coupling between the testharness module and your other modules.
